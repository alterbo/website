---

That Tuesday in February, 30 children escaped from school. It was cloudy and very cold. But it didn't snow. Some parents say that it was three students from the "Sun" class who first managed to escape from school. Other parents claim that the culprits of the children's escape were two first graders. On the other hand, the secretary and the janitor insist that it was a child from the "Moon" class who devised the plan. The school principal met with the parents of the suspected students, the students themselves, the secretary, and the janitor to solve the mystery. The principal rode her bike to work and was in a bad mood because of the cold, her nose red like Rudolph the reindeer. The mystery had to be solved, as the well-being of the school and the students' learning were at stake, like a ball about to leave the field.

That Tuesday in February, 30 children escaped from school. The children left their homes that morning covered from head to toe, with gloves, scarves, and hats. The principal crossed her arms and approached the parents of the 3 students from the "Sun" class. She wanted to know if their children had organized some kind of game related to what happened. They were David, Raúl, and Laura, dinosaur lovers, good at drawing, and skilled at writing vowels, both uppercase and lowercase. They had never been to the principal's office before, so they were scared. The principal stood in front of them, looking them up and down. "Confess!" she said. The 3 students from the "Sun" class burst into tears. They were too scared. That Tuesday, after escaping following a group of other children, David, Raúl, and Laura had gone to the wild boar park to jump on the rocks, but soon, cold and scared, they returned to school on their own.

That Tuesday in February, 30 children escaped from school. Most of the children escaped during recess, leaving their coats and hats to form bodies to deceive the monitors. The principal paced her office under the watchful eyes of the other people and children. She sighed. It was time to question the parents and children of the first grade, the oldest among the children. Pedro and Ramón spent all day playing at flying things: paper airplanes, artisanal parachutes, etc. That Tuesday, they had brought a kite. The principal stared at the two first-grade students: Pedro and Ramón. "Surely, boys," the principal said, "that day you wanted to fly the kite and left the school to be in the open air, right?" The children lowered their heads but denied it. "Right?" the principal asked again. The children shook their heads again.

That Tuesday in February, 30 children escaped from school. In the secretary's printer, 30 copies of a map of the school, drawn by some child, had been found. The principal nodded her head, thus the students from the "Sun" class, David, Raúl, and Laura, were innocent, as were the two first graders, Pedro and Ramón. The net was tightening, the solution to the mystery was about to be revealed. The principal, with the smile of someone who knows she is about to win, turned to the secretary and the janitor, who had assured that it was Gustavo, a student from the "Moon" class, who had created the map that enabled the escape, a detailed plan of the hours and movements of teachers and monitors, secret hallways, and fake doors. A plan that had been the guide for the escape. The principal asked for the child's parents, but they weren't there. She asked for his sister, but she wasn't there either. The principal had to sit down. And she asked for Gustavo, though without hope of receiving any satisfactory answer, like throwing a stone into the sea.

At that very moment, not far from there, Gustavo, his sister, and his parents were in a café, having hot chocolate and churros. It was starting to snow.
