Where are you coming from, Dad? the children asked. The father arrived with wet hair, but it wasn’t raining outside.

I’m coming from the swimmi, the father said, taking off his sweater.

The children giggled, covering their mouths and ears. From the swimmi? They ran down the hallway, bumping into each other.

From the swimmi? said the mother, who had come out of the kitchen, looking puzzled.

Yes, the father shouted. From the swimmi, I’ve been swimming for a bit, getting some exercise.

The children came back, laughing again. Dad talks with i's! Dad talks with i's!

You mean from the pool, said the mother, looking at his bag with his swimming gear.

Yes, the father shouted again. I must have swallowed some water.

But where? the mother shouted.

In the swimmi! the father yelled.

The mother turned around, not looking too pleased, since she was making dinner. The children watched closely until one of them asked, Do you know what’s for dinner tonight, Dad?

The father shook his head, shrugging.

For dinner tonight there is, one of the children said, spaghettini! The kids screamed and ran off down the hallway again.

The father groaned and got annoyed.

The next day, it still wasn’t raining, but once again, the father came home with wet hair. The children were waiting for him in the hallway. Where are you coming from, Dad? they asked, trying to hold back their laughter.

The father lifted his head and sighed. I’m coming from the swimmo.

The children burst out laughing. Dad talks with o’s! Dad talks with o’s!

The mother was sitting on the couch, glancing over her tablet while reading a book. Honey, put the wet clothes in the washero, the mother and the children laughed.

The father scratched his chin. I must have swallowed water again, he said thoughtfully.

The next day, it didn’t rain either. As soon as the father arrived, he was greeted by a sign written in a child’s handwriting: Welcome hommi!

How was the swimmo? the children asked him.

The following day, something good happened: it rained. The father arrived soaked, with his bag of swimming clothes. There were the mother and the children, waiting at the entrance. They looked him up and down, down and up, full of anticipation. What letter would he speak with today?

The father smiled. That day, he hadn’t swallowed any water while swimming. He had been perfecting his technique and improving as a swimmer.

I’m coming from the pool! the father shouted, euphoric.

Everyone clapped, hugged, and smiled, just like fish do when it rains.
