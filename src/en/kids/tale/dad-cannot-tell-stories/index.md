title: Dad cannot tell stories
---


Normally it's mom who reads at night. Dad is working in his office, and you can hear him typing and complaining when his code doesn't work. Mom has a sweet voice, and that helps when one wants to rest. Reading stories is like the magic sheet one wraps around before sleeping.

After the shower, and brushing our teeth, in our story-listening uniforms, we wait for mom with smiles of good children. They say that the more a child smiles, the better the story they are read.

Unfortunately, mom got hoarse, and the stories she read us started to become scary. So, the story of the moon turned into a lunar monster, and the story of the giraffe into the monstrous giraffe. For that reason, dad had to read us the stories before sleeping.

Dad came in sweating, having tried to make his code work, and had punched the computer desk a couple of times. He sat in the rocking chair, and it creaked, like when stepping on leaves in autumn. He opened a book and began to read.

We fell asleep at the first sentence. Dad told stories in a very boring way, never with intonation and a very static rhythm. Of course, he never gestured.

Dad started to practice storytelling. When we went to school, he gave us kisses, and then, he stood in front of the mirror and rehearsed the stories. Little Red Riding Hood walked with her arm hanging from the basket and a red shadow at her back. No! Dad scratched his head and tried again. Little Red Riding Hood hung from the basket with a red arm walking through the forest. No!

Then dad had to work, he went back to his office to punch the desk.

When we returned from school, dad greeted us with kisses and asked how our day had been. We told him it was very good, and that the day had been perfect. Dad went back to work. And we played and played and played, to then listen to stories and stories and stories. Oh no, but mom was still hoarse.

When storytime came, we turned off the ceiling light, turned on the bedside light, and sat on the bed with the best smiles we could muster. Dad didn't come. You could hear the banging on the desk through the walls. Mom had to shout with her hoarse voice for dad to come. Maybe he didn't want to come to tell the story because he knew we didn't like how he read the stories.

Dad arrived immediately, sweaty and thoughtful. He sat down, and the rocking chair creaked. He took a book, but instead of opening it, he looked at it and threw it into the dirty clothes basket. Then he cleared his throat and began to tell us a story about his work.

It was a story about flying codes that fought against the forces of the void and saved the princess. These flying codes unfolded their lines and then soared through the sky like true kings of the world.

The thing is, that was the best story dad ever told us, we were attentive to his words, his shouts, laughter, and even victory gestures throughout the story. When he finished, we felt that we didn't want to sleep, that we wanted to experience life and live adventures. But with some kisses, dad said goodbye and turned off the lights.

That night we slept very well.

That night we didn't hear any banging on the desk in the office.
