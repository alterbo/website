In the kingdom of Egypt, very close to the River Nile, where the breeze that reached the pyramids was born, lived our protagonist, Pascual.

Pascual was an Egyptian with bronzed skin, straight hair, and a determined walk.

In his class, Pascual stood out for his skills with the bow and in drawing ornamental figures; he was virtuous and humble.

He also stood out for another reason, Pascual hated cats.

In the times of pharaohs, the figure of the cat was the center of attention both in royal enclosures and in any family home. Naming a cat, that is, giving a name to the cat, was a matter of state and a subject of discussions and even sometimes wars. Petting a cat was another delicate matter, it was only allowed if the cat itself authorized it. Cats, not the pharaohs, were the center of the world.

Although there was an Egyptian who did not like cats, Pascual, in fact, he hated them. Pascual paid attention to the teachings of his teachers during classes, but when a cat suddenly appeared and everyone kneeled, Pascual remained standing, with his chin up and looking defiantly at the cat.

"Why don't you kneel before the cat, Pascual?" his classmates would ask him.

Pascual then told them that cats are treacherous, showing scratches on his arms. Afterward, Pascual would sit thoughtfully at his desk, sigh, and tell that he had heard stories about cats that barked. These cats lived further north, far from the river. These cats had claws that scratched the stones of the mountains and powerful teeth capable of crushing bones. They barked. When danger approached or when joy approached, they barked.

Pascual imitated the sound and his classmates looked at him strangely while the teachers shook their heads.

Pascual continued speaking: those barking cats are loyal and follow their masters, facilitating survival in times of war and could be decisive for the future of human beings as faithful companions.

Pascual would continue speaking normally until the cat meowed, that magical meow full of witchcraft attracted the attention of his classmates and no one listened to him anymore.

Pascual left the class somewhat sad and before returning home, he went to the river. He liked to hide on the shore and watch how the fish played jumping to a tree branch.

At nightfall, Pascual would look out his window and fine-tune his hearing, trying to listen beyond the Pyramids and travel to the horizon, where he dreamed of climbing mountains accompanied by The Cats that Bark.
