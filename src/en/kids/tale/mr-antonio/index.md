Once upon a time, in a very, very large city, there was a man who got lost, very lost. He couldn't find his house.

Disoriented, the man asked another passerby: "Excuse me, do you know where Antonio González Street is?" "Sorry, I'm not from this neighborhood," replied the other man.

Feeling somewhat sad, the lost man stopped another pedestrian. "Excuse me, Antonio González Street?" "Do you mean Antonio Lopez Street? That's the one over there," the pedestrian replied.

A woman passing by the area commented, "Around here, the only Antonio streets I know are Antonio Ricardo or Antonio Ricardos."

Suddenly, another passerby said, "We should ask Mr. Antonio; he knows his streets well."

Mr. Antonio had a large dark mustache and every time he smiled, which was often, he showed his teeth.

The group approached Mr. Antonio and asked him about the street where the lost man lived.

Mr. Antonio smiled for a moment and then, looking at the lost man, he asked, "What is your name, lost man?"

The lost man replied, "Juan Gonzalez."

Mr. Antonio became thoughtful while stroking his mustache. Then, after looking at the horizon, he said, "Of course, you, lost man, are not looking for Antonio Gonzalez Street, but for Juan Gonzalez Street."

The lost man suddenly remembered everything. It was like completing the last piece of a puzzle. The group of people began to congratulate and applaud. Everyone was happy.

Mr. Antonio smiled, showing his teeth, which were like white buildings under a mustache full of stars.
