All the parents in the neighborhood used to call on the owl Jimmy from time to time.

Jimmy was the famous owl that whispered to make silence.

When the children screamed or cried in anger, Jimmy the owl would come and calm them with his famous whisper.

The parents then connected their computers and took the opportunity to work.

That was life until one day, Jimmy the owl left the neighborhood.

Jimmy spread his leather wings, put gel in his feathers, and left.

Jimmy wanted to be a musician, not a resource for parents to calm their children.

Jimmy wanted to be a rock star, not a whisper.

The first thing that happened was that the parents, unable to work with their kids causing a ruckus, gradually started losing their jobs.

It seemed like a tragedy. The children screaming and the parents losing their jobs for not being productive enough. And Jimmy the owl was in a rock band.

The beginnings were hard for Jimmy. People who came to the concert fell asleep, and his voice was not suitable for music.

But Jimmy learned to adapt and ended up singing very well. People applauded and asked for more songs.

When he gained fame and prestige, Jimmy went on a concert tour and at one of those concerts, he returned to the neighborhood.

Jimmy remembered his roots, where he came from, so he took a walk through his old neighborhood.

The parents immediately recognized him and asked about his musical career.

Jimmy was sad when he learned that the parents had lost their jobs, but he was happy afterward to know and see that the time without working made the parents spend more time with their children. The children gradually calmed down and screamed less and less by themselves as they spent more time with their parents, which made them happy.

In that concert, Jimmy sang like never before and the parents and children sang and shouted with happiness.

To finish, Jimmy did his old whisper and fell asleep.
