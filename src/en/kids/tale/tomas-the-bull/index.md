title: Tomás, the bull
---

Tomás was a young fighting bull, black as the night. He grazed on a finca south of Madrid, frolicking with other herd mates in a very green meadow. They laughed, argued, chatted, etc. The young bulls liked to run around the olive trees. Some began to test their horns against the trunks of these trees. But basically, the life of a bull was calm, too calm, thought Tomás.

Tomás was constantly looking towards the higher part of the land. There, he saw his father, staring at the horizon, serious, veteran, chewing grass calmly.

The rest of the young bulls approached Tomás to play with them, but after his refusal, they asked about his father, up there on the higher part of the finca. In the meadow, they said that Tomás's father was next. Next for what? Tomás would ask. Next to go to a bullring.

The young bulls continued to play and again charged at the olive tree trunks, leaving marks on the bark like a painter signing his canvas. Tomás wanted to play again, but he was afraid. The bullfighting season was approaching, and his father was next.

With the good weather came the people from Madrid, taking photos with the young bulls who approached them, attracted by the shine of their phones and cameras. "Come take selfies!" the other young bulls would say to Tomás.

But Tomás shook his head. His horns were already becoming robust, and he was one of the best at marking the olive tree bark. Tomás distrusted the city people. They were the same ones who would go as spectators to the bullfight, to the battle between his father and death, Tomás thought.

"We'll save ourselves," the young bulls said, "if we take selfies with them, we'll be saved," they thought, amidst the panic that the roundness of a bullring, where there was no escape, caused in all bulls.

Tomás shook his head. The life of a bull was not to take selfies but to go up to the higher part of the finca and, from there, chew grass calmly until the day of battle. Tomás distanced himself from the other young bulls and took the same stance as his father. But he was afraid.

From the higher part of the finca, Tomás's father watched the horizon and at the same time, helplessly observed how his son was afraid. Tomás's thoughts were easy to guess even from a distance. The father thought over and over again about his destiny, his son's destiny, the destiny of all bulls.

One weekend, about 20 cars passed through the finca, lots of people, disrupting the tranquility. The young bulls were playing at dancing like robots, taking advantage of a car with the windows down playing music. They took selfies for a long time, next to the fence. They laughed and winked. "These charming bulls," the city people said.

Tomás again distanced himself; he had too much dignity in the figure of the bull. The role that a bull plays in the world.

That weekend, people were crazy; some even jumped the fence and began to play with the young bulls, pretending to bullfight with their colorful shirts. There were beer cans on the ground. The engines roared, and the cars emitted pollution. The young bulls retreated, but some were trapped between the people and the fence.

Tomás stood up when he saw that some friends were in danger, and began to trot towards the fence when suddenly, someone appeared on the scene.

Tomás's father, in an instant, came down from the higher part of the finca and reached where those playing with colorful shirts were. But Tomás's father didn't attack anyone. He had another strategy in mind. Changing direction, he charged at the metal fence with a powerful blow, and it broke into pieces. Such was the intervention that the people and the young bulls were astonished; nobody expected it.

In the blink of an eye, Tomás's father had freed his finca mates. All the bulls, young and old, reacted and ran out through the fence, escaping into the forest, trotting towards their freedom.

By breaking the fence, Tomás's father had been injured and was bleeding near the neck. But that wasn't the reason he stood still and didn't escape. The fence was broken, the bulls had escaped, but his son Tomás remained on the finca.

Tomás stood tall, his horns already shining in the sun, Tomás's father thought. But he didn't escape. Why?

The father looked at his son intently for a moment, a look that seemed like a dialogue, a conversation. Then, the father nodded his head, turned around, and began to trot towards the forest, soon catching up with the rest of the bulls and leading the herd to their salvation.

After the intervention, the people reconsidered. After that scene, the city people started picking up the cans from the ground, turned down the music, turned off the engines, and switched to eco mode in the cars. With serious and respectful faces, the people returned to Madrid.

Tomás remained at the top of the finca. The horizon from there was spectacular. The reddish colors of the sunset combined with the headlights of the vehicles as they moved away. Tomás lay down and began to chew grass, first very calmly, with interruptions, as the taste was unpleasant at first, then with a steady rhythm, decisively, like someone waiting to swallow, like someone waiting calmly.
