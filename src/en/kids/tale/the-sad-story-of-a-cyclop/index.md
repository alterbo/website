title: The sad story of a cyclops
---

A Cyclops was born in these modern times. They named him Ricardo. He was born at the Fundación Hospital. He became the talk of the hospital and the neighborhood.

A Cyclops in daycare, playing with other kids like any other. Laughing, growing, learning about the world, getting into fights. But crying less than the other kids with two eyes because he only had one.

The Cyclops had only one eye. That’s why they called him the Cyclops, even though his name was Ricardo.

When he started school, the first days were very awkward—everyone stared at him or pretended not to. Some pointed and asked their parents why there was a child with only one eye.

One parent responded by saying that there are also children with only one shoe.

Reading and counting were no problem for Ricardo. With his single eye, he began reading stories and writing dictations like anyone else in his class.

What made him popular at school wasn’t his mythological condition as a Cyclops, but his incredible aim.

Ricardo had a gift for throwing stones. Breaking things from a distance made him highly admired. He always walked away with stuffed animals from the fair, where he was also a master dart thrower.

During the festival at the meadow, when the fair stalls are set up and people play games of skill, Ricardo is constantly asked to play and win prizes for the other kids.

Among the lights and food stalls, the kids look for Ricardo, the Cyclops—they want him to win stuffed animals for them. But they can’t find him. The two-eyed kids search high and low but don’t see Ricardo.

Ricardo is far away, up above the park where the fair is held, on a hill, sitting on the grass.

He likes to climb up there and look at the horizon. With his single eye gazing into the distance, he feels a bit sad. Sometimes he wishes he had two eyes, like the other kids. But he finds comfort in watching the sunset, admiring the solitary sun.

Then he goes down to the meadow to shoot at balloons and wins many prizes.

Then he puts on his pajamas, brushes his teeth, and goes to bed with his stuffed animals.

He closes his single eye and sleeps through the night with a single smile on his face.
