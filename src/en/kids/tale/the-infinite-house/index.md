The visitor had not yet arrived.

The girl decided that inside the house she needed a more intimate space, a space where she really had her place. At the age of 3, she decided to build a house inside the living room. It was going to be a house within a house, like a game within a game.

This way, if the girl got bored during the visit, she could always retire to her own house without appearing rude.

To start the construction, the young builder collected large books, which she would turn into bricks to build the walls.

Some mats would serve as walls to provide stability to the structure.

For the roof, the girl had taken two sofa blankets, light but suitable as insulation from the outside.

It turned out to be a solid structure, with its slits as windows, and its manual doors acting as automatic doors.

If it rained in the living room, the girl thought, she would run to take shelter inside her house. There, she could spend a couple of hours perfectly, until the living room sky cleared.

She would have everything she needed inside: A bottle of water, two pieces of biscuits, paints, papers, and tape to decorate the walls with drawings.

And most importantly, the doll. The doll is the girl's favorite plush toy, she never goes without it, it's her adventure companion.

The doorbell of the house rang, the house in which the girl's house was. The girl's house did not have a doorbell yet.

Guests were coming. The girl hurried to get some cups and spoons to offer a snack to the visitors.

Inside, she took another look at her newly built house, everything seemed to be in order after cleaning up biscuit crumbs and straightening the drawings that adorned the walls.

The girl fixed her hair and asked the doll if her hairstyle was okay. The girl and the doll had different styles, but this time the doll nodded, the hairstyle was fine.

The visitors did not come. The girl was impatient. She already had her own house, but had not had much time to enjoy it because of the imminent visit. At any moment, the visitors would enter the living room.

Suddenly, the girl remembered she didn't have a doorbell, so she approached the entrance and manually opened the automatic door.
Just then, the visitors arrived.

Everyone praised the construction, calling it a beautiful house, a palace, a fortification, among other names.

The girl was happy, her effort had paid off. The reward was that the visitors would leave delighted, and then the girl could enjoy her house in a more relaxed way.

The visitors wanted to have coffee as a way to celebrate the event they had just experienced. The girl turned around and called the doll to help her serve the coffee.

The doll was nowhere to be seen. The girl shouted, but the doll did not appear. The girl searched the house but could not find the doll.

After a while, the visitors left delighted. The girl had been a good hostess, attending to her guests with politeness and generosity.

It was late, and the girl wanted to take off her shoes and lie down to rest and relax a bit. Then the girl remembered the doll.

Where could her doll be? She missed it, although it was true that she had not paid attention to it during the visit. The girl had been so attentive to the guests that she had neglected her doll, poor inseparable doll.

Surely, the girl thought, the doll had suddenly decided that it needed its own space, its own house. A house within the girl's house, within the house of the living room.

Surely, the girl continued to think, the doll would be in its own house at that moment, waiting for a visit that would not come. The girl felt a bit sad for her friend and changed her mind, changed her decision.

In a matter of minutes, the girl tore down her house, dismantled the walls, removed the books, and returned the blankets to the sofa that had served as a roof.

The girl had realized that building a house just for herself meant distancing herself from her doll, her inseparable friend.

Once the house was destroyed, the girl and the doll hugged as if they hadn't seen each other in a long time, and laughed for a while, dancing over the debris of the house.
At that moment, it started to rain in the living room.
