Sailing through the yellow field for 7 hours, we can reach the green meadow. There, we will find the house of the ponies.

As 7 hours is a long time, we will arrive tired and maybe thirsty, no problem, there is a stream of crystal-clear waters nearby.

The house of the ponies is made of wood and has its windows always open so that the wind can come and go as it pleases.

From the outside, we can see the interior, two rooms for two ponies. If they invited us in, it would be great, but that has never happened.

We have to limit ourselves to being spectators, to contemplate and enjoy the beauty of the ponies from the outside, for that we have walked 7 hours.

One of the ponies is pink and is always sleeping in the bedroom, the other is blue and is always eating in the dining room.

We could talk to the ponies, at least greet them, but they would not pay attention, always focused on their tasks, sleeping and eating.

If the pink pony stopped sleeping, the other pony could take its bed and rob it of its sleep. If the blue pony stopped eating, the other pony could take its food and leave it without sustenance.

We could tell them: hey ponies, what you are doing is absurd, you could share things, change tasks, be free and happy! But the ponies could close the windows and we would be left without a show.

On the return trip, we will reflect on the attitude of the ponies, we have 7 hours to think about it, 7 hours to reach a single conclusion.

Whenever there is a beautiful landscape, whenever there is a smiling stream, nearby, just a few meters away, we can always find a good pony and a bad pony.
