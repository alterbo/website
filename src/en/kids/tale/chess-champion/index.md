Hello. The other day, Lucas came over, bringing some cookies and a small chessboard in his backpack. Lucas is the chess champion at school and the top student in the chess extracurricular; in fact, he's better than the teacher.

When we got home, I showed him around the rooms as my mother suggested, except for the office where my dad was working, connected to a meeting with the door closed. My dad had also been a chess champion at school, like Lucas, but he doesn't play much anymore.

As we passed by the office, we could hear banging on the desk and cursing; my dad was probably trying to fix a code error. He sweats a lot when he programs, more than in August.

For a snack, my mom gave us Nutella sandwiches. It was hot, I remember the Nutella turning runny and getting all over our hands. Lucas had a Nutella mustache that looked like the mustache of another kid's dad. We laughed and then went to wash our hands.

My mom also had to join a meeting and asked me to bring the juices she had prepared to the living room. Then my dad came out of the office, and my mom went in and closed the door behind her. My dad, with a sweaty forehead and clenched fists, gave us a big smile when he saw us.

"How's it going, kids?" he asked.

Lucas is a bit shy and lowered his head. As his best friend, I'm always telling him not to lower his head, to look straight ahead. When Lucas plays chess, he does look straight ahead, staring at his opponent, studying them to see if he can come up with a good defense strategy or an attack ambush.

My dad patted him on the shoulder and asked if he still played chess. Lucas smiled. "Yes, Dad," I reminded him, "Lucas is the school champion."

My dad clapped and a moment later appeared with his fists closed, showing them to Lucas to choose the color of the chess pieces. Lucas picked the white piece.

We went to the living room for the game. He set up the board, lowered the blinds a bit, arranged the chairs around the table, cleared away the napkins from the food, and turned on the fan.

"Let's play, kids!" he said.

Both of them entered the living room. I smiled. My plan was in motion.

The idea of inviting Lucas over was mine. I asked my mom, and she talked to Lucas' mom, who agreed. My idea was to see who the real chess champion was, Lucas or my dad.

The moment had come; this game would decide the true champion of champions.

Lucas made the first move. "Aha! Bold move," my dad laughed. Parents have a dad-style sense of humor, but both Lucas and I made an effort to laugh. Lucas out of politeness, I suppose, and I because it was part of my plan to see who the champion was.

For an ideal game, the atmosphere had to be relaxed, without tension. My dad had already turned on the fan. That would keep him from sweating, and with the blinds slightly lowered, the light was perfect for concentration, and Lucas wouldn't have to squint from any annoying reflections. Plus, my mom was in a meeting and wouldn't come to tell us to sit up straight.

My dad moved a piece without thinking much either, and then Lucas lifted his head, shedding his shyness. They were face-to-face, starting their duel. I was on the side of the couch, like a judge presiding over the game. I felt like an adult; I had planned a strategy, and everything was going according to plan. It was almost time to rub my hands together. You could really say I was the winner, even though I wasn't playing, because no matter who won, I won!

I went to the kitchen for the juices my mom had prepared. They were pineapple, the kind that makes you pee a lot. They were refreshing on that hot afternoon, where only the fan's hum in the living room broke the silence. That made me think of the game again, so I quickly returned.

When I reappeared in the living room, I couldn't help but shout in amazement. I saw a drop of sweat running down my dad's cheek. That wasn't in the plan. My dad wasn't programming, and the fan was at full power, yet a drop of sweat was sliding down his face like a horse across a meadow. Lucas was sitting with an elbow resting on his knee, like a thinking statue. That wasn't in the plan either.

Lucas moved his bishop, and with a sharp diagonal, said "Check!" with his head held high, proud of himself. He had a typical smile of someone who launches the first attack. I was at the living room entrance with the tray of juices. My plan was failing, so I had to take action.

I cleared my throat like my uncle Juan, who smokes little cigars. And I shouted, "Here are the juices!" But no one paid attention. My dad was focused under his drop of sweat, trying to find a good defense, while Lucas remained imposing after making a check. This wasn't part of my strategy; my plan was failing. My dad was supposed to make the first check so that Lucas would make the next, and then who knows who would be the winner.

So I shouted again, "The juices!" and added, "Mom made them."

My dad and Lucas snapped out of their battle bubble and looked at me; both smiled. "Bring those juices here," my dad said, and Lucas smiled too, taking his glass with both hands. They seemed to relax.

I sighed in relief. I could still make my plan work; I still had a chance, but I couldn't waste any time.

Meanwhile, my dad and Lucas returned to their game. "Check," my dad shouted after three moves, crossing his arms and flexing his muscles. No! That wasn't in the plan either. Now Lucas was supposed to make the check, and he sat with his head down, seemingly defeated already.

I quickly acted. I discreetly walked around the back of the couch and turned off the fan. Immediately, not one drop but two drops of sweat crossed my dad's forehead, like a sailboat cutting across the sea horizon. Good, I thought, and looked at Lucas. He was lifting his head a little, starting to feel energized. Good, I thought, the plan is going well; I'll soon discover who the real champion is.

But just as that was about to happen, the office door opened, and my mom appeared. Oh no! I thought, looking at the game, my dad sweating and hunched over, and Lucas still with his head down. I panicked because I knew my mom was going to comment on the bad posture of those two chess players.

I anticipated and did what no one expected, not even myself: I grabbed the tray of juices and threw it onto the table, spilling juice over the chessboard and moving the pieces around. "What have you done?" my dad said. "Geez! How clumsy!" Lucas said. I apologized and said I would clean it up. My dad and Lucas shook hands and agreed to a draw. They both had won, and I had won, since both my dad and Lucas were happy and relieved.

My mom turned on the fan and looked at me from the living room entrance, winking and smiling. It had all been part of the plan.
