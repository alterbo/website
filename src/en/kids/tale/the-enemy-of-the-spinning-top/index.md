title: The Enemy of the Spinning Top
---


Hello, my name is J and I am the king of spinning tops. I'm the best at school, in English classes, and at the park. No one can beat me.

The key to my success is the wrist twist when I launch and a steady hand when holding the launcher.

My spinning top also plays a starring role, it's made of chrome-plated steel and emits a terrifying reddish glow when spinning.

At snack time, I'm always sitting on the ground, in front of my spinning top, waiting for challengers.

Some come, sit with their tops and lose.

Others walk by, knowing they will lose, and leave hugging their sad tops that seem tired of their owners.

But one day, a winter Tuesday, a boy sat in front of me, took a sky-blue spinning top out of his backpack, as if pulling a rabbit out of a magician's hat.

In a matter of seconds, his sky-blue top destroyed my terrifyingly glowing reddish top.

The circle of kids that had formed around me was amazed, they all clapped and cheered, there was a new spinning top king in the neighborhood.

However, the boy who beat me didn't want to be the spinning top king. He got up, serious and calm, put on his cap, and told me:

The child makes the top, not the top the child.

Then he walked away through the shaded area and was never seen again.

I learned my lesson; it's not about being the best but about being able to improve.

Now I play football. At snack time I go to the river and watch the birds flying until they disappear through the shaded area.
