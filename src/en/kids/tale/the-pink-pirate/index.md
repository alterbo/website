In the class of pirates, the color blue was the favorite of almost all the pirates. The teacher would ask, and someone would say: Blue, or Yellow, or Green, or Blue again, or Red, but nobody said Pink, except of course, the pink pirate.

The pink pirate was born near the river but ended up sailing the three seas.

There, by the river, in her neighborhood, the pink pirate would walk hand in hand with her mother to school, or she would ride on a skateboard and enjoy her hair waving in the wind, like the flag of the pirate ship with which she would end up sailing the three seas.

She also snacked on sweets from the bakery or climbed the wooden structures in the park, common things, like the rest of the pirates.

But beware, not all the pirates from the river neighborhood were going to sail the three seas. The pink pirate would, and not only the three seas, the pink pirate was going to fight against sharks, dodge storms, play navigating among the islands where she would hide her treasures, and she would be the first pink pirate to become a legend.

But that would be later, in the vastness of the ocean, thought the pink pirate, walking on tiptoes through the neighborhood with her light-up shoes, illuminating the street lamps and always giving the same answer to the teacher: My favorite color? Pink, of course.
