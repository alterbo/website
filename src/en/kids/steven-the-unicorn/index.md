Steven was a young unicorn who listened to rock n roll.
When he listened to music, he would move his mane up and down, bobbing his head and his horn.
He liked the music so much that one day his horn shot out from all the bobbing.
Steven ceased to be a unicorn and became a horse.

Steven was sad, but then he put on music again.
He went up and down the hills searching for his horn.

Near the river, Steven met a group of horses.

He asked them about his horn. The horses looked at him somewhat suspiciously.

How do we know you are the owner of the horn and not a horse like us?

Steven concentrated and emitted an Aura of happiness and harmony that made the forest shine.

The smiling and happy horses showed Steven the place where he could recover his horn.

Steven became a unicorn again, climbed the hill, and opened the windows of the landscape. The wind came in, moving the unicorn's hair.

Afterward, Steven played music, and the Moon said: oh yeah, sweet dreams.
