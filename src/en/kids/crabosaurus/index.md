As distant as a breakfast at dawn, there was, once upon a time, long ago, a crabosaurus.

This crabosaurus was as big as 4 buses, liked purple ferns, had tiny pincers for arms, and walked backwards.

While the rest of the dinosaurs went to the meadow in the happy valley, the crabosaurus went the other way and climbed a mountain.

Mountain after mountain, far from the fashionable valleys, the crabosaurus distanced itself.

It carefully smoothed its whiskers, as it had pincers for arms, and looked towards the horizon.

But it wasn't all about resignation.

When a hungry Rex or Spinosaurus came by, the crabosaurus also distanced itself.

In one spring, the dinosaurs, very curious they were, went to see the meteorite fall.

Not the crabosaurus, the crabosaurus went the other way.

When the cold came, the crabosaurus enjoyed the beach, until one day it left its giant mango juice and its sunglasses.

It stood up and decided to walk forward.

It went down mountains, went to the meadow in the happy valley, descended more mountains, faced Tyrannosaurus and Spinosaurus.

And meanwhile, it smoothed its whiskers, carefully, as it had pincers for arms.
