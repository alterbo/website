title: Rafael, the robot dragon
---


Rafael descended from a dynasty of robot dragons.

Robot dragons were the most advanced generation of dragons and were characterized by functioning like robots.

Functioning like robots meant flying with the precision of a robot, speaking with the neutrality of a robot, or doing the robot dance at parties.

Rafael's grandfather, famous for reaching a distance of 200 meters with his fire breaths, already enjoyed flying like a robot.

Rafael's father, capable of reaching the stratosphere in flight, also spoke like a robot in his family environment.
Rafael was born and grew up wanting to be a robot dragon. And so he was.

At the dragon graduation party, Rafael earned the medal of a robot dragon.

And there he went from side to side with his smile full of sharp teeth and moving across the dance floor with the grace of a robot.
