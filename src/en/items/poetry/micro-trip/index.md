I was born in the state of inebriation, north of Aragon.

For 20 years I read books and magazines.

I crossed the Ebro many times, above, like the birds, but without wetting my beak.

I speak 3 languages but only use 2.

I have 10 shoes but only wear 2.

I have a single phone, a single family, and a single God.

Today an alarm went off: 40 years ago I was born in the state of inebriation.

It's been 20 years since I read. I no longer cross the Ebro. I travel south, The birds say.
