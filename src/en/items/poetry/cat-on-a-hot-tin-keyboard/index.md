Juan posted the comment "the cat on the zinc keyboard" on the channel. Someone asked him about the movie, maybe the novel by Tennessee Williams?

Jenny wrote about her husband, with whom she shares a desk, about pounding the keyboard like a Led Zeppelin drum set.

Luis is somewhat older and brings up the example of a colleague of his who wrote code like one of the Marx Brothers, the middle one, the one who played the piano with his index fingers.

Maxi is Latino and plays salsa music in the background, which can be heard through his microphone when he's not muted. Maxi presses the enter key as if he were a gunslinger.

Shooting at the enter key with the index and thumb extended, Sam Peckinpah and his wild keyboard.

The wrestling fighter thinks about climbing onto the office chair, making a guttural sound, and tensing his muscles to then jump onto the table and hit the enter key with his elbow to send the form.

Or those movies where the Nazis are seen typing with their leather gloves.

On the keyboard, the F and J keys have notches that make these keys more inclusive and thus easier for typists to locate.

They are like two nipples.

It's as if the Psalms of St. Matthew, key F8, function 11, help us to move forward when debugging and finding our mistakes.

And Pink Floyd always ends up playing, and you turn the keyboard over for the first time and see that it's made in California with love.

And you can't help but feel nostalgic, just like David Hasselhoff. His wallpaper will be present on everyone in the office who doesn't lock their computer.
And Ctrl+Alt+Del Ctrl+A Ctrl+C Ctrl+V Ctrl+Z.

Dorothy searching for the way of the yellow key road.

Two keyboards per hand like a prodigious musician.

It's a matter of using nostalgia and typing forward.

And meeting with Google, with Siri, with Alexa, and telling them no, no voice control, you pay for their coffee and leave.

And you're smiling under the mask.

And that's what matters.
