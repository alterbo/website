title: Meeting in room 8080
---


Room 8080 was on the second floor, in the office called Localhost. I had a meeting there at 10:30. I remember that day I was wearing a white shirt, new shoes, and socks without holes.

I went up to the second floor and looked for room 8080. By that time, 10:17, the shoes were already hurting me, or maybe it was the socks without holes. Room 8080 was closed, and after trying to open the door, I found that I didn't have access.

I went to get a coffee to pass the time. I went up one floor to the office called Code Freeze. There I grabbed a long coffee and then went down the stairs, slowly because the shoes were killing me. Room 8080 was still closed, and there was no one inside. It was 10:22.

I checked the schedule and decided to sit in the hall to wait calmly. I took the opportunity to unlace my shoes and discreetly slip out my heel to reduce the suffering, the pain I was immersed in caused by the new shoes.

There were people walking quickly past me. They were going here and there, probably stressed, to their respective meetings. They wore white shirts. I noticed their shoes, polished, impeccable, probably new as well. But by the way they walked, polished, impeccable, those people did not seem to suffer from shoe pain.

Then I understood what I had to do. I took my socks and began to make holes in them. I put the socks back on and felt the pleasure of my toes slipping through the holes. I put on the shoes, my dear new shoes, and stood up like a spring.

Room 8080 lit up when I approached its door, and I was able to enter. It was 10:30.
