The bridge is a great place to meet someone. It’s a common meeting point, so there are always people leaning on the railing, checking their phones, or looking around as they wait.

Recently, the central square has been closed for renovations. This has made the bridge the preferred spot to meet, to the point where there are now more people waiting on the bridge than crossing it from one side to the other.

Local residents are protesting and demanding restrictions. They suggest banning waiting on the bridge. There are so many people that the bridge, already quite old, might give way and collapse. The locals walk nervously with their shopping bags, not relaxing until they’re safely home.

The neighborhood children have taken the lead in the protest and managed to halt the renovations in the central square. They protest on behalf of the bridge. Take it down, good people! Let the colorful fish see the sky again.
