He told me that his favorite book was 'Los investigadores salvajes', 'The Wild Researchers.' It turns out that the writer of this novel, Roberto Bolaños, worked during the summers in a parking lot. That left him time to dedicate to his poems.

Sometimes, when leaving the parking lot after work, it would be raining, but since he didn't have an umbrella, he would splash through puddles.
