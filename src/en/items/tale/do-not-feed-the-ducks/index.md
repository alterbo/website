If you feed the ducks in the Manzanares, you run the risk of being confronted by Ramon who will reproach you with open arms as follows:

Oye amigo, if you feed the ducks, you will get a bill from the police.

He pulls out a supermarket receipt from his pocket and waves it in the air.

You will have to pay, lo pagar√°s.

Look at the river, it's kind of charming, with its leaves over there and the plants that grew from nowhere.

There are birds that flew to reach this place of nature.

They are cool birds, like ducks.

Ducks have their own businesses.

Ducks with one head, ducks that don't like being fed.

Because ducks with 3 heads don't pay bills.

They always run away, with their 3 heads thinking 3 thoughts. Or more.

Then Ramon closes his arms and leaves.
