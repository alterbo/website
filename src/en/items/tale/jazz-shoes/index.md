My old shoes left new footprints, which the trackers of Miles Davies could easily follow.
The trackers were the advanced group, the ones who went back and forth until they found the right path for Miles Davies to hunt me down.

I bought those shoes some time ago for 20 euros and started walking to wear them out.
On one occasion, I even stepped, unintentionally, on a 50-euro bill with my 20-euro shoes.

The footprints remained new, and the trackers were hot on my heels.

I began to walk in circles, retracing my steps, creating old footprints.
Some of Miles Davies' trackers would lose the trail, but not all of them—it would be difficult because there were too many.

There were dozens, hundreds, miles of Davies.
