As a neighbor of the river, I'm used to suffering from mosquitoes. They wake me up in the middle of a nap, in the middle of the night, and during restless sleep.

I can be zen and move on, sleep less, fight more, but the issue is that mosquitoes invade my privacy and bother my children. My wife sighs more and more, like that dubious judge who still hasn't made a decision.

Solutions found on Google:

Insect repellent for bugs
Mosquito nets on the windows of our castle
Online course on killing mosquitoes
Anti-mosquito air freshener
Hermetic isolation
I have enrolled in the online course for killing mosquitoes, there are still spots available, in case you're interested.
