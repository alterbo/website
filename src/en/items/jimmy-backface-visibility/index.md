When you meet Jimmy, you realize that there are things in life worth cherishing.

At his workplace, Jimmy tells you that his girl introduced him to the world of programming and good practices for writing quality code. His girl used to sit three desks to the left of Jimmy. You might wonder, dear reader, whose left I am referring toâ€”your left, dear reader, or the left of Jimmy Backface Visibility. Well, it's the same left.

Jimmy's girl changed jobs, cities, and left Jimmy. This broke our friend's heart.

While driving home from work, Jimmy confides in me about some things. He would have done a rollback of everything, to go back to a previous, stable version, without knowing the world of programming, good practices, or her. But then he always says that one must look forward and plays some music and accelerates.
