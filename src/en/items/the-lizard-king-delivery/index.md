"I am The Lizard King. I can do anything," says Jim Morrison, manager of the transportation company.

His vans are visually elegant, the logo, the slogan, everything is suitable.

But it wasn't all a path filled with roses, Jim Morrison tells us, at the beginning there were only thorns.

During the early deliveries of The Lizard King, it was Jim Morrison himself who was behind the wheel of his van, Pam.

Those were very hard working days, many hours within hours.

Jim would leave Pam double-parked while making deliveries. In the loading and unloading zone, on the sidewalk. Jim always separated from Pam.

Those were days of elevators and stairs, of ambulances and buses annoyed at finding Pam, Jim's van, in the middle of the street, blocking the way.
Those were days of broken windows and stolen goods.
Those were days of sex during delivery.

"Now I have a consolidated business," Jim Morrison tells us.

During dusk, the vans return to the garages, where they regain the shine of their logos, fill their bellies with packages to deliver, and wait for dawn, like a lizard resting on a rock to absorb heat.

Jim locks the garage with a padlock and invites us to order packages from The Lizard King to check what he says.

We will go home, at night we will close the curtains and blinds, and order something from Amazon.
Inside our homes, we will be safe. But what will happen when someone rings the intercom?
Will it be The Lizard King Delivery? The one who can do anything?
